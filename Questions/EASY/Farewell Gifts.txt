Problem Statement:

Ms. Smith, a dedicated teacher, is preparing farewell gifts for her n students at the end of the school year. She plans to give each student a jigsaw puzzle, but the puzzles available in the shop vary in difficulty and size. Ms. Smith wants to carefully choose n puzzles in such a way that the difference between the largest and smallest puzzle sizes is minimized.

Given the number of students n, the total number of puzzles available m, and the number of pieces for each puzzle, find the minimum possible difference between the largest and smallest puzzle sizes that Ms. Smith can achieve.

Input:

The input consists of two lines:

1) The first line contains two integers separated by a space: n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), the number of students, and m (n ≤ m ≤ 50), the total number of puzzles in the shop.
2) The second line contains m integers separated by spaces, f1, f2, ..., fm (4 ≤ fi ≤ 1000), representing the quantities of pieces in the puzzles sold in the shop.

Output:

Print a single integer, the minimum possible difference that Ms. Smith can achieve between the largest and smallest puzzles.

Example:

Input:

4 6
10 12 10 7 5 22

Output:

5

Explanation:

Ms. Smith needs to choose 4 puzzles from the available 6. One possible selection is puzzles 1, 3, 4, and 5 with 10, 10, 7, and 5 pieces respectively. This choice yields the minimum difference of 5 between the largest and smallest puzzle sizes.
