Problem Statement:

Lena, a third-year elementary school student, is currently learning addition. Her teacher has written down a sum consisting of multiple numbers. Lena's task is to calculate the sum, but she can only do so if the summands are arranged in non-decreasing order. For example, Lena can calculate sums like 1+1+2 and 3+3, but not 1+3+2+1.

Given the original sum written on the board, your task is to rearrange the summands and provide a new sum that Lena can calculate.

Input:

The input consists of a non-empty string s representing the sum that Lena needs to calculate. The string s contains no spaces and consists only of digits and the character "+". 
The sum is valid and contains only the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The length of string s is at most 100 characters.

Output:

Print the new sum in a format that Lena can calculate.
